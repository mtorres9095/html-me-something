             On 31 December 2019, the WHO China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of
             unknown etiology (unknown cause) detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. 
             The 44 patients reported with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported to WHO by the 
             national authorities in China. Of the 44 cases reported, 11 were severely ill, 
             while the remaining 33 patients were in stable condition.

             From 22-23 January 2020, The WHO Director- General convened an Emergency Committee (EC). The independent
             members from around the world could not reach a consensus based on the evidence available.
             They asked to be reconvened within 10 days after receiving more information. On 30 January 2020, 
             The WHO Director-General reconvened the EC, earlier than the 10-day period, the EC reached 
             consensus and advised the Director-General that the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency
             of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General accepted the recommendation and declared
             the novel coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV) a PHEIC.

             The WHO-China Joint mission, which included experts from Canada, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, 
             Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore and the US (CDC, NIH) spent time in Beijing and also
             travelled to Wuhan and two other cities. They spoke with health officials, scientists and 
             health workers in health facilities (maintaining physical distancing). The report of the 
             joint mission can be found here:

             WHO and partners launch the Solidarity Trial, an international clinical trial that aimed
             to generate robust data from around the world to find the most effective treatments for COVID-19.
             On 13 March, Italy’s death toll topped 1,000 as confirmed cases in the country swelled to more
             than 15,000. On 23 March, the WHO said more than 300,000 cases were reported from almost
             every country in the world. Johns Hopkins University, which cited slightly different numbers,
             reported that global coronavirus infections were on track to reach 350,000.

             On 1 April, Chinese officials announced new lockdown guidelines for all villages in the
             country’s central Jia county, in an effort to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections.
             On 6 April, New York saw its "largest single-day increase" in deaths, with the state’s
             fatalities rising by 731 in the past 24 hours. The state had 138,836 confirmed cases and
             5,489 total deaths.  While hand-washing with soap and water has been advocated worldwide to
             keep the coronavirus at bay, some 74 million people in the Middle East lack access to a sink,
             soap or basic water facilities at home, a United Nations report found. On 25 April, China 
             reported no new coronavirus deaths for the tenth consecutive day.

             On 1 May, Russia reported a record number of new coronavirus cases for the third day
             in a row, with 7,933 new infections confirmed, bringing the country’s total number of
             cases to close to 115,000. Russia became the eighth hardest hit country in the world
             in terms of the number of confirmed cases. Nationwide, Russia recorded 1,169 coronavirus
             deaths, which is low among countries with that many cases.
